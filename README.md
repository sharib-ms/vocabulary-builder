# vocabulary-builder
The main target is to practise python creating a program which allows to learn basics of a few languages at the same time.
The idea is to creat an interface like a flash-cards where a few languages can be seen. 
Vocabulary files must be easily changed, so the user can change what to learn.
familyDict.py - is all the code
folder img/ contains images of flags
folder vocab/ contains vocabulary: 1 txt file for each language. Words with the same meaning have to be at the same line in all the vocabularies. familyDict.py reads the same line from all the vocab.txt files.
